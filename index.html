<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of the workshop is to bring together people from different subfields such as algebra/coalgebra, verification, logic, around the thematic of fixed points. Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science. They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and associated reasoning techniques. The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation of programming languages, logics, verification, databases.
<br>

Topics include, but are not restricted to:
<ul>
<li>fixed points in algebra and coalgebra </li>
<li>fixed points in formal languages and automata </li>
<li>fixed points in game theory </li>
<li>fixed points in programming language semantics </li>
<li>fixed points in proofs </li>
<li>fixed points in the mu-calculus and modal logics </li>
<li>fixed points in process algebras and process calculi </li>
<li>fixed points in functional programming and type theory </li>
<li>fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits </li>
<li>fixed points in automated theorem proving, interactive theorem proving and logic programming </li>
<li>fixed points in finite model theory, descriptive complexity theory, and databases </li>
<li>fixed points in category theory for logic in computer science </li>
</ul>
<br>
FICS 2026 is organized by Gianluca Curzi (University of Gothenburg) and Florian Bruse (TU Munich)

<h2>Call for Submissions</h2>

Submissions will be handled via Easychair. Please visit <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fics2026" target=_blank> https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fics2026</a> to submit your contribution.
At least an author of each submission will be expected to present the contribution in person at FICS 2026.
<br>
This year, we welcome two categories of submissions, short abstracts as well as extended abstracts:
<ul>
<li>Short abstracts are abstracts of 3 to 5 pages, references included, describing the topic of the proposed contributed talk. They may contain (i) newly completed results, (ii) work in progress or (iii) already (recently) published or submitted works. The submission can refer to a published paper or a preprint but the description given in the short abstract should be sufficiently detailed for the PC to judge the relevance of the proposed talk to the workshop program.</li>
<li>Extended abstracts are papers of 6 to 10 pages, references excluded, describing original results which have not been published nor are currently submitted elsewhere. The results must be presented in sufficient details to constitute a scientific publication. An appendix can provide additional details for the reviewers but will be read at their discretion.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Papers should be submitted in EPCTS format (see <a href="https://info.eptcs.org/" target=_blank>https://info.eptcs.org/)</a>. Papers diverging substantially from this standard my be rejected.
Submissions from the program committee are permitted and encouraged.

<h2>Proceedings</h2>
We hope to be able to offer post-proceedings for the extended abstracts in an EPTCS volume.
<br>
Depending on the number and quality of submissions, extended versions of selected contributions may be invited to a (planned) special issue of Fundamenta Informaticae.
