<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of the workshop is to bring together people from different subfields such as algebra/coalgebra, verification, logic, around the thematic of fixed points. Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science. They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and associated reasoning techniques. The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation of programming languages, logics, verification, databases.
